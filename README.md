PubSub
======

PubSub is a simple library for creating publish/subscribe "hubs".
A _hub_ is composed of **subscribers** which subscribe to various **topics**.
The hub can then **publish** (broadcast) a message for a given topic and all
subscribers of that topic will be sent the message.

Annotated source code: http://bruth.github.com/pubsub/docs/pubsub.html
Tests: http://bruth.github.com/pubsub/test/index.html

```javascript
var hub = new PubSub;
var output;

hub.subscribe('foo', function(msg) {
    output = msg;
});

hub.publish('foo', 'hello world!');
output; // 'hello world'
```

Late Subscribers
----------------
PubSub has support for _catching up_ late subscribers due to one reason
(async subscription) or another. The default behavior is to iterate over
the whole history (in it's current state) for that topic and publish to
the subscriber.

```javascript
var hub = new PubSub;
var output;

// a publish occurred before any subscribers were defined
hub.publish('foo', 'hello world!');

hub.subscribe('foo', function(msg) {
    output = msg;
});

output; // 'hello world'
```

The ``history`` parameter supports ``'full'`` and ``'tip'``. If any other
value is specified, none of the topic's history will be applied.


History API
-----------
PubSub has a very simple history API with ``undo`` and ``redo`` methods.
For [idempotent][1] subscribers, only a single function is required to be
supplied (like the above example).

For non-idempotent subscribers, two handlers should be supplied representing the
``forwards`` and ``backwards`` operations. The below example shows this.

[1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence

```javascript
var hub = new PubSub;

function Counter() {
    this.count = 0
    this.incr = function() {
        this.count++;
    }
    this.decr = function() {
        this.count--;
    }
}

var counter = new Counter;

hub.subscribe('click', counter.incr, counter.decr);

hub.publish('click');
hub.publish('click');
counter.count; // 2

hub.undo();
counter.count; // 1

hub.redo();
counter.count; // 2
```

If the history API is not used at all, the ``backwards`` is not necessary
regardless of the idempotency.

Unsubscribing
-------------
When a subscription occurs, a ``sid`` (subscription ID) is returned which can
be used to reference the subscriber in the future. That ``sid`` can be passed
in to temporarily unsubscribe (or fully remove) the subscriber.

```javascript
var hub = new PubSub;
var output;

var sid1 = hub.subscribe('foo', function(msg) {
    output = msg;
});

hub.publish('foo', 'hello world!');
output; // 'hello world!'

hub.unsubscribe(sid1);

hub.publish('foo', 'new message');
output; // 'hello world!', nothing changed

hub.subscribe(sid);
output; // 'new message', it caught back up

// completely removes it from the hub. the sid is no longer valid
hub.unsubscribe(sid, true); 
```

Topics can also be unsubscribed. Rather than requiring an ID, simply use
the topic name itself.

```javascript
var hub = new PubSub;
var output;

hub.subscribe('foo', function(msg) {
    output = msg;
});

hub.publish('foo', 'hello world!');
output; // 'hello world'

hub.unsubscribe('foo');

// no history is recorded while a topic is unsubscribed
hub.publish('foo', 'new message');
output; // 'hello world!', nothing changed

hub.subscribe('topic');
output; // 'hello world!', still nothing changed

// completely removes it from the hub. the topic and all of it's subscribers
// are removed from the hub.
hub.unsubscribe('foo', true); 
```
