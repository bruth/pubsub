    # Subscriber
    # ----------
    # A subscriber is composed of a ``handler`` handler. An optional
    # ``context`` can also be supplied to be the context for the handlers.
    #
    # ``tip`` represents the last message this subscriber has received. A
    # subscriber can be deactivated at any time by setting ``online`` to
    # ``false``. This prevents future messages from being received. If the
    # subscriber comes back _online_, it can optionally receive the queued
    # up messages since it was last subscribed.

    # Message
    # -------
    # A message is created and sent by it's ``publisher``. It is composed
    # simply of the arguments passed in on a ``publish`` call. The content
    # will be passed to the subscriber's handlers.
    class Message

    # Publisher
    # ---------
    # Messages are send via a publisher whom broadcasts them to it's
    # subscribers. Similarly to a subscriber, a publisher can also
    # be deactivated. During this time, no messages will be queued nor
    # broadcasted to it's subscribers.
